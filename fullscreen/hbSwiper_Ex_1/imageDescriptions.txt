01_Piz_Boe.jpg	<h2>Piz Boe (Dolomites)</h2>View from Piz Boe down into the valley. The Piz Boe (3152 m) is the highest peak of the Sella Group in the Dolomites. If you climb up the south side (some steeper sections are secured by wire ropes), you have this magnificent view down just before you reach the summit hut.
02_Passo_Stelvio.jpg	<h2>Stelvio Pass - Queen of the Alpine Passes</h2>The Passo Stelvio (Stelvio Pass) is also known as the "Queen of the Alpine Passes" and is a special challenge for sports cyclists. After almost 26 km of ascent you reach the pass height of 2757 m. With two other passes in France, the Stelvio Pass is one of the three highest motorable passes in the Alps. - Here you can look back at the Hotel Franzenshöhe, which is 6 km before the top of the pass. In the last 6 kilometers there are the famous 48 hairpin bends that give the climb a terraced course.
